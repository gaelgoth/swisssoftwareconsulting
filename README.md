Switzerland offers great comfort, excellent infrastructure, quality living and square working conditions. It has a beautiful landscape where leisure activities for the summer and winter abound. Although mainly known for its finance and pharma industry many giant tech companies are looking to expand here. They have been opening new offices since 2013 and are recruiting talent in Switzerland. This includes Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Sony, Huawei, GitHub, Twitter and Zalando. Moreover, Google's largest office in Europe is in Zurich!

Product companies aside, I've done a lot of researching on service companies during my job search in the past. In contrast to product companies service companies offer client exposure and higher adaptability. They have a smaller but much more specialized workforce. You get to see many different aspects of the same work and study new industries and their challenges. Service companies are also smaller and nimble. They adopt latest technologies and tools early on. This allows them to provide the latest and most profitable solution for their clients.

The list below is meant for UX designers, web developers, (embedded) software engineers, project managers, DevOps engineers, database administrators and consultants who wish to broaden their horizon, grow their technical skills and work for a fast-growing constantly evolving market. Hope it helps you in your quest!
