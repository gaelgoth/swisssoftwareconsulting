Switzerland is a tiny affluent island in the heart of central Europe. It has a beautiful landscape where leisure activities for the summer and winter abound. Although mainly known for its finance, insurance and pharma industry many giant tech companies are looking to expand here. They have been opening new offices since 2013 and are hiring fiercely. This includes Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Sony, Huawei, GitHub, Twitter and Zalando. Moreover, Google's largest office in Europe is in Zurich!

Product-based companies aside, I've done quite some researching on service companies during my job search in the past. Service companies offer client exposure and higher adaptability. They have a smaller but much more specialized workforce. You get to see many different aspects of the same work and study new industries and their challenges. Service companies are also smaller and nimble. They can adopt the latest technologies and tools early on. This allows them to provide the latest and most profitable solution for their clients.

Here's a curation of services companies in Switzerland. It is meant for UX designers, web developers, (embedded) software engineers, requirements and test engineers, project managers, DevOps engineers, database administrators and consultants who want to enhance their skills and enjoy working for a fast-growing constantly evolving market.
